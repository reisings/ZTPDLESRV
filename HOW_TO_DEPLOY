This will load a CentOS 7 server with Apache, DHCP and TFTP servers along with Ansible, PyEZ, Perl and it has the Data Learning Engine loaded.
 
I’m still trying to figure out how to get the Vagrantfile to push the right one for the project so follow these steps to get it working.
 
On your laptop make sure you have Virtualbox (has to be 5.1 or lower doesn’t look like they have caught up to 5.2 VBox): https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1
 
Make sure that you have vagrant loaded: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
 
Create a folder to house the machine ( I used vagrant_ztp on my mac): mkdir vagrant_ztp; cd vagrant_ztp
 
Vagrant init sreisinger/centos7ztp
 
This will place a Vagrantfile in the directory but we need to replace the contents until I can figure out how to do it on Hashicorp.
Also you can manipulate the IP Addresses to fit your environment here
Remove or edit Vagrantfile and replace with the following contents (also attached the file for easy download)
 
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :
 
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "sreisinger/centos7ztp"
  config.vm.box_version = "0.0.1"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox"
  config.ssh.port = 22
  config.ssh.username = 'vagrant'
  config.ssh.host = '192.168.56.20'
  config.ssh.password = 'Juniper123'
 
  # Management ports
  config.vm.network 'public_network', ip: "192.168.2.192", nic_type: '82540EM', virtualbox__bridged: "BRIDGED_EXTERNAL"
  config.vm.network 'private_network', ip: "10.1.1.1", nic_type: 'virtio', virtualbox__intnet: "ZTP_Internal"
  config.vm.network 'private_network', ip: "192.168.56.20", nic_type: '82540EM', virtualbox__hostonly: "HOST"
 
  #FIX NAT INTERFACE NOT ACTIVATED
  config.vm.provider 'virtualbox' do |vb|
    vb.customize ['modifyvm', :id, '--cableconnected1', 'on']
  end
  
end
 
Once you have edited or replaced that file with the above you only have to issue the command: vagrant up
You will be prompted to tell Virtualbox which of your true laptop/server interfaces to use for the bridged interface
Within 10 minutes (depending on your internet connection) you should have a fully functional centos7 server ready for ZTP and DLE and Programming.
Here is the capture of the test session I just ran to stand this up in my lab:
 
Scotts-Mac-mini:Downloads sreisinger$ mkdir vagrant_ztp
 
Scotts-Mac-mini:Downloads sreisinger$ cd vagrant_ztp/
 
 
Scotts-Mac-mini:vagrant_ztp sreisinger$ vagrant init sreisinger/centos7ztp
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.

Scotts-Mac-mini:vagrant_ztp sreisinger$ vi Vagrantfile     ß This is the step you need to vi the Vagrantfile or edit it or replace it – if you do not you will get a single NAT interface
